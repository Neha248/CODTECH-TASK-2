OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: Temperature Converter
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b42147-53a3-48c0-8c55-5ef3c072bb53)

 
Objective : The objective of this project is to make a simple Temperature converter between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This will allow the user to input the temperature in one scale and get the converted output in another scale.
Key Activities: 

•  Get User Choice:

Read the user's choice for which conversion to perform.

•  Get Temperature Input

Read the temperature value from the user based on the selected scale.

•  Perform Conversion:

Based on the user's choice, convert the input temperature to the desired scale using appropriate conversion functions.

•	Conversion Functions:

o	celsiusToFahrenheit(float c): Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.

o	celsiusToKelvin(float c): Converts Celsius to Kelvin.

o	fahrenheitToCelsius(float f): Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

o	fahrenheitToKelvin(float f): Converts Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

o	kelvinToCelsius(float k): Converts Kelvin to Celsius.

o	kelvinToFahrenheit(float k): Converts Kelvin to Fahrenheit.


Technologies used

•	C language : The primary language used for the quiz game.

•	Standard Input/Output Library (<stdio.h>):Used for reading user input and displaying questions, answers, and results on the console.

•	Terminal/Command Line:The environment where the program is executed and where players interact with the quiz

•	Functions:Defined functions for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Functions help modularize the code and make it reusable and organized.
